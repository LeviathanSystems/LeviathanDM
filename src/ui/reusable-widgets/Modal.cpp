// Backward compatibility implementation
// Modal classes have been moved to separate files:
// - BaseModal.cpp for the base Modal class
// - KeybindingHelpModal.cpp for the keybinding help dialog
//
// This file is kept for build compatibility but is no longer used.
// Include the actual implementation files in your build system instead.
