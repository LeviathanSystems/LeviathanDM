# Example Wallpaper Configuration with Wallpaper Engine Support
#
# This example demonstrates how to configure both static image wallpapers
# and Wallpaper Engine animated wallpapers in LeviathanDM.

wallpapers:
  # Static image wallpaper example
  - name: nature
    type: static  # or "image" or "static_image"
    wallpaper:
      - ~/Pictures/wallpapers/mountain.jpg
      - ~/Pictures/wallpapers/forest.png
      - ~/Pictures/wallpapers/ocean.jpg
    change_every_seconds: 300  # Change every 5 minutes

  # Single static wallpaper (no rotation)
  - name: favorite
    type: static
    wallpaper: ~/Pictures/wallpapers/favorite.png
    change_every_seconds: 0

  # Wallpaper Engine animated wallpaper example
  - name: animated-scene
    type: wallpaper_engine  # or "wallpaperengine" or "we"
    wallpaper: ~/.steam/steam/steamapps/workshop/content/431960/XXXXXXXXXX
    change_every_seconds: 0  # WallpaperEngine wallpapers don't rotate (yet)
  
  # Multiple Wallpaper Engine wallpapers (with rotation)
  - name: we-rotation
    type: wallpaper_engine
    wallpaper:
      - ~/.steam/steam/steamapps/workshop/content/431960/XXXXXXXXXX
      - ~/.steam/steam/steamapps/workshop/content/431960/YYYYYYYYYY
    change_every_seconds: 600  # Switch between them every 10 minutes

# Monitor Groups
monitor_groups:
  - name: desktop
    monitors:
      - identifier: "DP-1"
        wallpaper: nature  # Use the static nature wallpaper
        
      - identifier: "HDMI-A-1"
        wallpaper: animated-scene  # Use WallpaperEngine wallpaper

  - name: laptop
    monitors:
      - identifier: "eDP-1"
        wallpaper: favorite  # Use single static wallpaper

# Notes on Wallpaper Engine:
#
# 1. Path Format:
#    - Wallpaper Engine wallpapers are typically installed in:
#      ~/.steam/steam/steamapps/workshop/content/431960/<workshop_id>/
#    - Replace <workshop_id> with the actual Steam Workshop ID
#
# 2. Requirements:
#    - You must have Wallpaper Engine installed via Steam
#    - The wallpaper must be subscribed in the Steam Workshop
#    - The wallpaper files should contain a project.json file
#
# 3. Current Limitations:
#    - WallpaperEngine support is experimental and not fully implemented
#    - Deep integration between linux-wallpaperengine (OpenGL/GLFW) and 
#      wlroots (compositor rendering) is required
#    - Currently, WallpaperEngine wallpapers will log a warning but won't render
#    - Static image wallpapers work fully
#
# 4. Finding Workshop IDs:
#    - Browse Wallpaper Engine Workshop: https://steamcommunity.com/app/431960/workshop/
#    - The workshop ID is in the URL: ?id=XXXXXXXXXX
#    - Or check your local installation directory
#
# 5. Future Development:
#    - Full WallpaperEngine integration requires implementing an OpenGL context
#      that can render to wlroots buffers
#    - This is a complex task requiring deep knowledge of both systems
